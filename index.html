									<p>A Multiplayer shooter game using c++ and blueprints.  </p>
									<p>The journey through multiplayer game development within Unreal Engine was an immersive experience. I grasped the intricacies of connecting players worldwide via matchmaking sessions and crafting a versatile plugin to transform any Unreal Engine project into a multiplayer sensation. Delving into programming the intricate mechanisms of multiplayer matchmaking in Unreal Engine was both challenging and rewarding. Learning replication techniques tailored for high-speed, competitive shooter games was a pivotal aspect, as was optimizing network code to ensure peak performance while minimizing bandwidth usage. Tackling lag compensation techniques, such as client-side prediction and server-side rewind, was crucial for creating seamless multiplayer experiences. Designing a diverse arsenal comprising pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, rocket and grenade launchers, and grenades added depth and strategy to gameplay. Introducing pickups like shields, health, speed and jump buffs, and ammo pickups further intensified the competitive landscape. Implementing player actions such as crouching, aiming, jumping, strafing, reloading, and throwing within a multiplayer framework was challenging yet immensely gratifying. Constructing a functional HUD displaying health, shield bars, ammo count, scores, defeats, and game timers contributed to the game's immersion. Crafting custom game modes, match states, and understanding the core multiplayer classes—Game Mode, Game State, Player State, Player Controller, Pawn, Character, and Actor—were instrumental in shaping the game's structure. Developing a personalized subsystem to manage online sessions and integrating Unreal Engine's Online Subsystem for multiplayer gaming across platforms like Steam was a significant achievement. Adding dynamic announcements for eliminations, game winners, winning teams, and countdown timers, alongside custom match states allowing free exploration during warmup and highlighting winners during cooldown, elevated the multiplayer experience to new heights.</p>

									<p>A Thirdperson rpg game using c++ and blueprints.</p>
									<p>Creating an RPG action game in Unreal Engine 5 is a thrilling journey. I'll start by designing a character for sword combat and creating enemies that challenge the player. Adding health bars and stats will deepen the gameplay.

										I'll use Unreal Engine 5's Open World system to craft vast, immersive environments and Quixel Megascans to make scenes look realistic. The Motion Warping feature will enhance character animations, making movements smoother.
										
										To intensify combat, I'll include effects like blood splatter and weapon trails, and Unreal Engine 5's MetaSounds for top-notch audio. I'll code using best practices and smart algorithms for efficiency.
										
										Designing various enemies, from human fighters to monsters, will add excitement. I'll seamlessly bring dungeon levels into the Open World map for a richer game world.</p>

									<p>A Top down RPG multiplayer game using Gameplay Ability System(gas).</p>
									<p>Learning the Unreal Engine's Gameplay Ability System was a game-changer, allowing me to craft intricate multiplayer gameplay mechanics. Building a comprehensive RPG from scratch, complete with combat systems, experience tracking, leveling up, diverse enemies, spell mechanics, interactive menus, and robust game-saving functionalities, was a fulfilling challenge. Embracing SOLID coding principles and adopting AAA-quality code architecture became integral to creating a solid foundation for the game's development. Understanding when to utilize Blueprints versus C++ for optimal performance in a finished game was crucial, ensuring efficient execution and scalability. Developing code that's scalable, modular, maintainable, and adaptable formed the bedrock of a reliable foundation for any serious game project. Moreover, mastering core features of the Gameplay Ability System alongside code debugging tools and practices amplified the ability to troubleshoot and refine the gameplay experience, ensuring a polished and seamless final product.

									<p> A UI course.</p>
									<p>Throughout this Unreal Engine course, I've unlocked a world of possibilities in game design. I've learned to build menus using Widget Blueprints, getting comfortable with variables, functions, and writing detailed Blueprint scripts. Crafting character menu screens has been a highlight, making them not just static but interactive, responsive to player actions. The magic of binding data from spreadsheets to elements within these screens has truly opened doors for managing character information efficiently. Learning to create, load, and overwrite game saves was a crucial step toward creating a seamless gaming experience. Making character data editable within the game, allowing for updates and changes, has been a satisfying aspect of this journey. And finally, toggling playable characters has added a layer of dynamism and choice for players, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.</p>
